# Open World Recognition in Image Classification - MLDL2021

This repo contains files for the project "*Open World Recognition in Image Classification*", for the Machine Learning and Deep Learning course at PoliTO. 

The repository is rganized in this way: 
- **baselines** folder: contains all the jupyter notebooks that implement the baselines for the Incremental Learning scenario.
- **classifiers** folder: contains all the the jupyter notebooks that implement a short ablation study on the classifiers used in iCaRL baseline
- **losses** folder: contains all the the jupyter notebooks that implement a short ablation study on the losses used in iCaRL baseline
- **model** folder: contains all python files that implement the different models used in this work. 
- **owr** folder: contains all the jupyter notebooks that implement an Open World scenario, with a naive rejection strategy and with *our proposal*
- other: support files and libraries

Contributors to this project are: Albanese Antonio, Maggio Leonardo and Nedescu Ionut Csmin
